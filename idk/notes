#Create a program that takes in input, prints out input

#Create a program that takes in 2 values in 2 lines, and output the sum of the values

#Make a program that takes in 3 values and output a list containing those 3. (harder version: write the code in 5-7 lines)

#Make a program that takes a password as input, then checks it with the stored password,and output true/false.

#Replace a string(input) with something else. Example: INPUT: "PLe" OUTPUT: "PLS"

#array 1st number + array last number + dnum(input)
array = [2,2,3,4,5,6,7]
dnum = float(input())

print(array[0]+array[-1]+dnum)
